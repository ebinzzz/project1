“GET PROJECT” 
In the rapidly evolving educaƟonal landscape, access to comprehensive 
resources and project ideas is crucial for college students. Our project aims to 
address this need by developing a web-based plaƞorm using HTML, PHP and 
SQL designed specifically for college students seeking inspiraƟon and learning 
materials for their university projects. 
The core features of this plaƞorm include a user-friendly interface that 
allows students to explore a wide array of project ideas, categorized by 
disciplines and areas of interest. These project ideas will be sourced from 
universiƟes and educaƟonal insƟtuƟons worldwide, providing students with 
diverse opƟons to choose and refer from. In addiƟon to project ideas, the 
plaƞorm will offer a rich repository of educaƟonal materials, including videos, 
arƟcles, and documents, to aid students in their project development and 
learning journey. These resources will be curated and organized to ensure easy 
access and relevance to various academic subjects and topics. 
The project will focus on user experience, ensuring that students can 
easily search, filter and mark their favourite project ideas and learning 
materials that align with their academic pursuits. It also contains a panel for 
the user to enquire any doubts about the projects or about the plaƞorm. 
Reference Videos and Materials: The plaƞorm offers an extensive 
collecƟon of reference videos and materials, helping students gain a deeper 
understanding of their coursework and project requirements. 
Trending Projects: Students can stay up-to-date with the latest trends in 
college projects. The plaƞorm showcases currently trending projects, providing 
inspiraƟon and guidance for their own work.
Categorized Projects: Projects are categorized by different branches of 
study, making it easy for students to find relevant examples and resources 
tailored to their academic discipline. 
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is intuiƟve and easy to 
navigate, ensuring that students can quickly access the informaƟon they need 
to enhance their projects. 
 “GET PROJECT” aims to empower college students with the tools and 
knowledge necessary to excel in their academic pursuits. This project seeks to 
bridge the gap between theoreƟcal learning and pracƟcal applicaƟon, 
ulƟmately enhancing the overall educaƟonal experience for students. 
By creaƟng a centralized hub for project ideas and educaƟonal resources, 
this web-based plaƞorm will empower college students to excel in their 
academic endeavours and foster a culture of collaboraƟve learning and 
innovaƟon within educaƟonal insƟtuƟons. 
UlƟmately, this project seeks to enhance the educaƟonal experience of 
college students, providing them with the tools they need to excel in their 
studies and contribute to the development of innovaƟve projects that benefit 
society as a whole.
